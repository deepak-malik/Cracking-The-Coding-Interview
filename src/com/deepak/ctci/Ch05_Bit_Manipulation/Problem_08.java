/**
 * <br> Problem Statement :
 * 
 * A monochrome screen is stored as a single array of bytes,
 * allowing eight consecutive pixels to be stored in one byte.
 * The screen has width w, where w is divisible by 8 (that is,
 * no byte will be split across rows). The height of the screen,
 * of course, can be derived from the length of the array and 
 * the width. Implement a function that draws a horizontal line
 * from (x1, y) to (x2, y). The method signature should look like,
 * 
 * drawLine(byte[] screen, int width, int x1, int x2, int y)
 *
