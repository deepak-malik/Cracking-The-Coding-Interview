/**
 * <br> Problem Statement : 
 * 
 * You have two numbers represented by a linked list,
 * where each node contains a single digit. The digits
 * are stored in reverse order, such that 1's digit is 
 * at the head of the list. Write a function that adds
 * the two numbers and returns the sum as linked list
 * 
 * Ex: Input : (7 -> 1 -> 6) + (5 -> 9 -> 2). That's 617 + 295
 * Output : 2 -> 1 > 9. That is, 912
 * 
 * FOLLOW UP : Suppose the digits are stored in forward order.
 * Repeat the above problem.
 * 
 * Ex. Input : (6 -> 1 -> 7) + (2 -> 9 -> 5). That's 617 + 295
 * Output : 9 -> 1 > 2. That is, 912
