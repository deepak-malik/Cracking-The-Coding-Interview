/**
 * <br> Problem Statement :
 * 
 * Imagine you have a call center with three level of employees :
 * respondent, manager and director. An incoming telephone call
 * must me first allocated to a respondent who is free. If the
 * respondent cant't handle the call, he/she must escalate the 
 * call to the manager. If the manager is not free or not able
 * to handle it, then the call should be escalated to director.
 * Design the classes and data structures for this problem. 
 * 
 * Implement a method dispatchCall() which assigns a call to the
 * first available employee.
